                <li class="desc"><b>Dynamic Keyframes • </b> 
                    This project involves the implementation of dynamic keyframing, which vary depending on factors such as the position and velocity of the ship at the moment the keyframed animation is triggered. These factors will affect the time it takes to complete the animation, as well as the position of the ship once the animation is finished.

                <li class="desc"><b>Particle Effects • </b>
                    We can view random particles generated whenever the ship is accelerating in the forward direction. Once the ship reaches its highest speed, the particle colors will shift towards a blueish hue.
                    <br><br>
                    Particles are also created whenever the asteroids are destroyed. The number of particles varies depending on this size of the asteroid that was destroyed, with bigger asteroids creating more particles.
                </li>
                
                <li class="desc"><b>Collision Detection • </b>
                    Collision detection is managed through bounding spheres for both the asteroids and the spaceship. When initialized, each asteroid has a predetermined radius that is used to calculate the size of its hitbox. Continuous sphere-to-sphere collisions are performed for the spaceship and all of the asteroids. Laser beams are represented internally by line segments, and line intersections are performed to check if they collide with any asteroids while they are "active".  
                    <br><br>    
                    Whenever the hitbox of an asteroid overlaps with the hitbox of the spaceship, the spaceship either explodes or takes "damage" in the form of a life.
                    <br><br>
                    Lasers are represented by line segments. A special collision detection is used to determine whether or not the line segment intersects the hitboxes of the asteroids.
